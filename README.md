## Introduction

This is a sample implementation of CQRS / Eventsourcing Infrastructure in node.js using:

- [domain](https://github.com/adrai/node-cqrs-domain)
- [eventdenormalizing](https://github.com/adrai/node-cqrs-eventdenormalizer)
- [viewmodel, read/write repository](https://github.com/adrai/node-viewmodel)
- [eventstore](https://github.com/jamuhl/nodeEventStore)
- [business-rules and validation](https://github.com/adrai/rule-validator)

### get it up and running JUST TESTING
        
1.  start server in _host_ and _domain_ folder

        node server.js
        
1.  direct your browser to 

        http://localhost:3000
        
the source code is well documented to understand the core principles.

## got the sample - where to go now?

This modules are the result of open sourcing parts of a large reallife project of a distributed system based on the principle of 
DDDD and CQRS. It's gone through a lot of iterations and should address most pitfalls.

The API is designed well so you can focus on the domain without worring to much about the infrastructure.
